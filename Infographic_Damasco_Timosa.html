					The majority of primary schools, high schools, and colleges still offer computer science as an elective. We live in a society driven by computer technology.  Computer science is a discipline that advances computing. A growing number of students are choosing to major in computer science, using their education to launch lucrative careers in fields like business, engineering, and healthcare, to name a few.<br>

					<h2 class="hfirst">Don't procrastinate</h2>
					<p class="first">
					You've heard it a million times before, however, it is important to always remind you that don't procrastinate! Don't procrastinate your studies, assignments, and even preparing for your examinations. If you have any predisposition to delay, you may want to pursue an alternative subject of study. The worst thing you can do in a computer science is to procrastinate. Let us always remember that time is gold, so use it wisely!

						A student fascinated with video games, 3D animation or computer technology may decide to get into computer science, only to find that most of their time is spent on learning how to program different languages. However, if you're not interested in programming, you probably aren't really interested in computer science and won't enjoy it. This is not to say that computer programming is in any way miserable. If you like computer games or animation, there are other career paths, such as Computer Game Design, Graphic Arts, Technical Writing, and even Business Management, that will allow you to work in these industries. Just be aware that if you decide to pursue a computer science degree, you must be prepared and eager to begin programming.

					<div id="main3">
					<h2 class="hthird">Study Math</h2>
					<p class="third">
					Math and computer science go hand in hand. If math is not your strong suit, computer science might be difficult for you. For instance, discrete math is used by software developers to determine the effectiveness and complexity of algorithms. Computer science researchers employ math-based probability and statistics to accomplish measurements and comparisons. When creating 3D animation, even video game programmers employ mathematics. If you want to learn and study computer science, you must also learn mathematics.

					<div id="main4">
					<h2 class="hfourth">Don't Cram</h2>
					<p class="fourth">
					As we just pointed out, procrastinating doesn't work when it comes to studying computer science. The same holds true for cramming. If you attempt to stay up all night to finish all your deadlines, you'll get weary, will have a hard time understanding you code, or you'll wind up failing your test and quizzes! Computer science is a topic of study where it's vital that you stay on top of things and maintain working throughout the full semester. It's not to imply you need to spend every waking moment studying computer science. It is to say that you need to study consistently throughout the year.

					<div id="main5">
					<h2 class="hfifth">Socialize</h2>
					<p class="fifth">
					It's crucial to be self driven and have the capacity to work independently, but it's just as important to be able to operate as part of a team. Learning to study in a group and work as a team is vital. Studying with a group as you seek an education in computer science offers a lot of benefits. Those people will educate you, and will develop and improve your skill as a team player. Not only that, it can help you in the industry to cooperate and share you ideas with others to create innovative things!

					<div id="main6">
					<h2 class="hsixth">Learn To Write More Than Just Code</h2>
					<p class="sixth">
					Programming is at the foundation of computer science, but you also need to know how to write to be successful in this discipline. Throughout the computer science semester, writing skills can help you produce better academic papers. It can also be a great communication skill to further express your ideas. Not only that, it can improve your academic performances!

					<h2 class="hseventh">Take Advantage Of All Resources Available</h2>
					<p class="seventh">
					Don't throw in the towel the first time you become stumped or hit a roadblock. There is a plethora of materials that can guide you learn more about computer science. In this day and age of the world wide web, the Internet has dozens of online resources from forums to tutorials to virtual instructors that may help you work through even the most tough computer science challenges.
